# Linux Journal Downloader

Linux Journal Downloader is a script that helps 
to download digital editions of the magazine with ease.
The script has three modes
    - Download all issues
    - Download specific issue 
    - Download (and email) the latest issue

I put the script as a cronjob, so it automatically emails
me the latest issue in my preferred format. Convenient.

Using the script is somewhat self-explanatory, see usage
for instructions:
    ./lj_downloader.py --help

*Note:* using the script succesfully requires subscription to 
Linux Journal. It's a great magazine so go ahead and subscribe at
their [site](http://www.linuxjournal.com/).

## Requirements

None. At least none that I know. Python 2.6.5, but it probably
runs on older versions too.

## Author

Markus Kauppila (markus.kauppila@gmail.com, @markuskauppila)

## License

The script is licensed under MIT license. By the way, if you
end up using the script, I'd appreciae if you let me know about it.

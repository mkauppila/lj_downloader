# Linux Journal Downloader

Linux Journal Downloader is a script that helps 
to download digital editions of the magazine with ease.
The script has three modes:
* Download all issues
* Download specific issue 
* Download (and email) the latest issue

I put the script as a cronjob, so it automatically emails
me the latest issue in my preferred format. Convenient.

Using the script is somewhat self-explanatory, see help
for instructions:
```bash
    ./lj_downloader.py --help
```

**Note:** using the script succesfully requires subscription to 
Linux Journal. It's a great magazine so go ahead and subscribe at
their [site](http://www.linuxjournal.com/).

## Requirements

None. At least none that I know. Python 2.6.5, but it probably
runs on older versions too.

By the way, if you end up using the script, I'd appreciate if you let me know about it.
